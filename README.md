### Overview
This analysis aims to identify states with favorable transportation conditions while defining the parameters of "optimal" transportation. It utilizes key transportation metrics like commute times, public transportation usage, and average vehicles per household as evaluation criteria. Our focus narrows down to average commute times as a quality indicator. We connect to US Census Demographic Data in Tableau for analysis.

### Key Features
- Bar chart visualizing average commute times across states.
- Interactive elements for user-driven data exploration.

### Insights
- Examines factors affecting commute times, including city size, public transportation efficiency, and geography.
- Provides population insights for a comprehensive view of the transportation landscape.
